Parts required for build:
  -Augio PCB
  -Optional switch plate
  -Case --either source a custom made case or send the case files to Ponoko or similar service
  -63 diodes
  -63 switches
  -2u stabilizer
  -Pro micro

The firmware works for both the ortholinear and staggered version
Note: The case files can be ordered from Ponoko.  There should be two open layers, and at least one closed layer in order to clear the USB and bottom of the PCB.

The ortholinear version is reversible, if you prefer the numpad on the right side.  However, the pro micro needs to be flipped.
